                    Dating apps have altered traditional methods of meeting love partners by reducing the reliance on social media for matching. Traditionally, individuals might meet possible partners through common friends, family gatherings, or social gatherings. However, sites such as Tinder and Bumble allow users to interact with a far larger pool of potential companions outside of their social groups. According to Smith (2023), this shift allows people to pursue relationships with people they may never meet in their daily lives, leading to a more diversified dating pool. Despite these benefits, the effectiveness of online dating has been challenged for encouraging shallow relationships. Many users indicate that relationships built through apps are less deep and stable than those formed through traditional channels (Johnson, 2022).

                    Individuals' dating behaviors have also changed as a result of the influence of online dating platforms. According to Lee (2024), the anonymity and distance provided by these platforms might lead to "online disinhibition," in which users feel more free to express themselves in ways they might not in face-to-face conversations. While this might help with initial relationships, it can also lead to misrepresentation and unreasonable expectations, as individuals frequently design their online identities to attract more matches. Further, research shows that the growing use of dating apps can have a negative impact on mental health, causing anxiety and low self-esteem when interactions do not fulfill expectations (Davis, 2023). The quick pace at which relationships form online frequently accelerates physical intimacy while postponing emotional connection, changing how people approach romantic relationships.

                    Dating apps have democratized the dating experience by making it more available to a wider range of people. According to Thompson (2022), they cater to a wide range of demographics, allowing users of varied origins, ages, and orientations to meet mates who share their interests. This accessibility lowers the barriers that traditionally excluded groups may experience in making romantic connections. In addition, online platforms frequently include features that allow users to filter possible matches based on specific criteria such as interests, values, and relationship goals (Roberts & Kim, 2023). This level of personalization contrasts strongly with traditional dating strategies, which rely mainly on accidental encounters or societal approbation. As a result, many people now consider internet dating a legitimate and productive way to find mates, leading to a cultural shift that normalizes looking for love online.

                    Online dating has allowed individuals to efficiently reach out to their potential partners due to technological advancements. However, it has gained a negative connotation for promoting superficial relationships and unreliable connections. According to Sharabi & Dorrance-Hall (2024), the tendency known as the ‘online dating effect’ results from online daters reporting fewer stable and fulfilling marriages compared to those who engage in traditional dating. Moreover, online dating apps profit from their users, focusing more on adding features that prompt users to curate their identities and pay for exclusive access to additional features, thereby increasing their exposure to more potential partners (French, 2022).

                <p class="center-text">
                    In addition to disrupting conventional methods of finding love, the rise of online dating coincides with a shift in attitudes and practices surrounding relationships and marriage, with more people putting off marriage or opting to stay single (Anderson et al., 2022). Furthermore, online dating has altered the pace at which individuals get to know each other, as connections formed online typically develop into sexual partnerships much more quickly than in traditional relationships (Ferguson, 2022). On the contrary, online dating offers individuals a more private space to interact with potential partners, often away from the social sphere, which contrasts with the public nature of traditional dating practices.

                <p class="center-text">
                    Likewise, online dating opens up a wider range of potential relationships, as users can set their preferences and location on these apps, allowing them to connect with more people who align with their interests. However, it can be harder to truly get to know others through a screen, as what is seen online often represents a curated version of themselves (Dunlop, 2018). In contrast, traditional dating typically involves forming relationships through acquaintances and face-to-face interactions, providing individuals with the opportunity to assess each other personally and gauge their intentions more clearly, in contrast to the digital realm of online dating.
