                <p>Technology has evolved to the point where digital products and services now offer new ways to enhance and improve work across various industries. These innovations are called <b>"Disruptive Technologies"</b> and the term was <b>introduced by Clayton Christensen and Joseph Bower (Schuelke-Leech, 2017)</b>. 
                </p>
                <p>Such digital products are altering new methods of how consumers, industries, or businesses operate. These innovations sweep away established workflows and processes (Smith, 2022), which is why they’re considered disruptive.

        <h2>TRADITIONAL IN-PERSON DATING</h2>

         <div class="row-2" >
            <div class="dispcon">
                <p> Dating in person in the Philippines involves lots of nuances which stems from the old traditional dating cultures, particularly the custom of ligaw or courtship. Unlike in Western cultures, where the direct question “Will you be my girlfriend?” is common, in the Philippines, the process begins with the more formal and respectful “Can I court you?” This question signifies the suitor’s intention to prove himself worthy of the woman’s affection while respecting her autonomy in the decision.

        <h2>CHALLENGES OF TRADITIONAL DATING</h2>
    </section>

        <div class="dispcon">
        <ul class="horizontal-list">
            <li>
                <h4>Societal Pressure and expectations</h4>
                <p>Traditional dating involves a lot of factors, including pressures, expectations, and influences from family and the community. There are pressures to conform to societal expectations, such as dating for marriage, gender roles, and certain rituals and norms.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Limited Opportunities</h4>
                <p>People are restricted when it comes to traditional dating, as it relies on personal connections, chance encounters, and social groups such as school, the workplace, or neighborhood, which limits options and exposure to diverse people and backgrounds.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Time-consuming</h4>
                <p>Going on in-person dates, setting up dates, and attending various social events with the hopes of meeting someone new can take up a lot of time. Relationships also develop more slowly in traditional dating because of cultural norms, such as gradual courtship.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="horizontal-list">
            <li>
                <h4>Financially Consuming</h4>
                <p>Traditional in-person dating can be financially consuming, especially when going on multiple dates with the hopes of finding the right person. Dinner at a restaurant, transportation, entertainment, and gifts can become overwhelming. In traditional dating, there are unequal financial expectations due to gender roles and norms that expect that one partner, traditionally the man, to pay for most or all expenses.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Limited Access to Information</h4>
                <p>Compared to modern dating, which uses dating apps that include profiles and backgrounds, traditional dating is a blank slate in which the initial impressions may be based on physical appearance or the interactions themselves when they meet face-to-face. </p>
